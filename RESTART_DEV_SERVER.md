# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Restart Dev Server

## The Issue

The Blog hero section height is still different because the **dev server is using cached code** from before the changes.

## Solution

**You MUST restart the dev server** for the changes to take effect:

### Steps:

1. **Stop the dev server**:
   - Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running

2. **Clear the cache** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   rm -rf .next
   ```

3. **Restart the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Hard refresh your browser**:
   - Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - Firefox: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

5. **Check the Blog page**:
   - Navigate to `localhost:3000/blog`
   - The hero height should now match the Portfolio page

## What Changed

- Blog page now uses the shared `PageHero` component
- Same height as Portfolio: `h-[60vh] md:h-[70vh] lg:h-[80vh]`
- All pages now have consistent hero sections

## If Still Not Working

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Try in an incognito/private window
4. Make sure you're on the latest code: `git pull`

**The build is complete and correct. You just need to restart the dev server!**
